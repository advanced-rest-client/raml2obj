The number of seconds can include decimal digits to arbitrary precision. As an example, 7 months, 2 days, 2hours and 30 minutes would be expressed as P0Y7M2DT2H30M0S. Truncated representations are allowed provided they conform to ISO 8601 format. Time periods, i.e. specific durations of time, can be represented by supplying two items of information- a start instant and a duration or a start instant and an end instant or an end instant and a duration. The OTA standards use the XML mapping that provides for two elements to represent the specific period of time; a startInstant and a duration. "
